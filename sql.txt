1 To get all distinct value from a column
	select DISTINCT	from films;

2 To count number of rows in columns
	Select COUNT(*) from table;

3 To count and distinct values in table
	select count(distinct colname) from table;			#distinct is pass inside count()
	
4 To do multiple conditon
	select * from table where id=3 and name='tushar';

5 Between is used to filter out values in a specific range
	select * from table where year between(2000,1000);

6 Like in sql to find pattern
	
	select * from table where year Like 'd%'	[all name start with d]

7 AGG function
	select avg(colName) from table;		#use sum() max() in place of avg()


8 To alias, you use the AS keyword, which you've already seen earlier in this course.
	SELECT MAX(budget) AS max_budget, MAX(duration) AS max_duration FROM films;

9 ORDER BY IS used to do sorting
	select name from people order by name ; 


10 Group by operation
	select release_year,avg(duration) from films group by release_year;

11 aggregate functions can't be used in WHERE clauses. For example, the following query is invalid:
	SELECT release_year FROM films GROUP BY release_year 
		HAVING COUNT(title) > 10;
